# Scoreboard
This React application enables you to add a 
player and keep track of their scores. It also
provides a stop watch for counting the time a 
player takes to play a certain game.

*Note: I developed this using the [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-basics) React
beginner course. Though I used ES6 for the 
implementation*
